<h1> Lights...Camera...Action</h1>
<p>Basic Outline of the Filmmaking Process </p>
</header>

<p> No matter what you're creating (movie, tv show, short film) the steps are all the same.</p>
<h2>Pre-Production</h2>
<p>After you've brainstormed and have you're idea, you will start pre-production. Here, you will plan out all the logistics for your project like: the budget, schedule, cast & crew, and of course the script. </p>
<p>Your role on the roject will determine what you'll be doing during this phase</p>
<p>You'll need to go through your script and take note of every character, set, and prop. Then you will need to figure out a budget that will fit the project, or change some things in the script to make it less exspensive</p>
