<h1> Lights...Camera...Action</h1>
<p>Basic Outline of the Filmmaking Process </p>
</header>

<p> No matter what you're creating (movie, tv show, short film) the steps are all the same.</p>
<h2>Pre-Production</h2>
<p>So, you have an idea you think is good enough for the big screen? Now you're ready for the first stage: pre-production.</p>
<p>First you'll need to write your script. This can take a very, very long time, but you don't want to rush the process because the script is the foundation of the entire project.</p>
<p>You'll need to go through your script and take note of every character, set, and prop. This will help you figure out a budget that will fit the project, or change some things
     in the script to make it less exspensive</p> 
     <p>You will also need to plan out the rest of the logistics like: schedule, locations, cast, and crew.</p>
