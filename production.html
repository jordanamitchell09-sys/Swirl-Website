        <h2>Production</h2>
        <p>Production is the hardest step of filmmaking in my opinion. To must people it's probably a lot more fun than determining a budgest, but its very easy for things to go wrong</p>
        <p>During pre-production there was probably a schedule made. This schedule determines what the call sheet will look like. Who shows up when and where.</p>

            <p>Crew will probably show up to set first and start setting up the lights and cameras.</p>
            <p>The director will run through the blocking (aranging where actors are meant to be in a scene) with the actors before they shoot for real.</p>
            <p>The camera operator will start rolling, the director will yell action, and the actors will begin the scene. This may hapen a few times for one given shot, but on some sets, directors like to go with the first take</p>
